# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

An implementation of some meta-heuristics and local searches to tackle the famous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

## Getting Started

Open terminal, navigate to the "src" directory and run the compile shell script: compile.sh to compile the code

```
[download directory]/inf1771/src > ./compile.sh
```

### Prerequisites

g++

```
g++ -g -o main *.cpp
```

## Running the tests

The "src" directory contains four shell scripts that solve the CVRP for their respective names, all you need to do is run them 
```
[download directory]/inf1771/src > ./X-n101-k25.sh
[download directory]/inf1771/src > ./X-n110-k13.sh
[download directory]/inf1771/src > ./X-n115-k10.sh
[download directory]/inf1771/src > ./X-n204-k19.sh
```
